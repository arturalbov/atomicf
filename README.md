atomicf is a go package for ensure files with atomic writing by using logging.
Implemented according to https://danluu.com/file-consistency/. Should prevent file corruption on any Linux filesystem.


It contains `type AtomicFile struct` decoration over standard `os.File` where `func (file *AtomicFile) Write(data []bytes) (n int, err error)`  and `func (file *AtomicFile) WriteAt(b []byte, off int64) (n int, err error)` are atomic.

File could be recovered after corruption using `func (file *AtomicFile) Recover() (err error)` function.
